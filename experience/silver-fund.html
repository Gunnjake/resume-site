  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    BYU Silver Fund is one of the oldest and largest student-run investment funds in the United States,
    managed entirely by students across finance, accounting, economics, mathematics, and computer science
    under faculty supervision in the Marriott School of Business. Students conduct original research, make
    live investment decisions, and are directly accountable for fund performance. Alumni of the program have
    gone on to leadership roles across top firms in the finance industry.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a Full Stack Engineer, I maintain and extend a production-grade investment analytics platform that
    supports multiple student-managed funds, including an undergraduate fundamental fund, a graduate
    fundamental fund, and a quantitative fund. The platform is used weekly by portfolio managers and analysts
    to evaluate performance, analyze time-series data, and support investment decisions.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Responsibilities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Maintain and manage four core repositories that collectively power the Silver Fund analytics platform,
      ensuring reliability, consistency, and clean integration across backend services, data pipelines, and
      frontend dashboards.
    </li>
    <li>
      Design and implement backend features using FastAPI and PostgreSQL, including a data download project
      that enables users to export time-series performance data as CSV files for external analysis and reporting.
    </li>
    <li>
      Work directly with the production database, writing and optimizing queries and supporting data processing
      pipelines using Polars to handle portfolio returns, benchmarks, and historical performance data.
    </li>
    <li>
      Contribute to frontend development by improving UI and UX across dashboards, including interactive charts,
      tables, filters, and CSV download functionality used by portfolio managers.
    </li>
    <li>
      Collaborate closely with a multidisciplinary engineering team through weekly team meetings, shared planning,
      and coordinated development cycles to deliver features aligned with fund needs.
    </li>
    <li>
      Participate in structured Git workflows by reviewing pull requests, providing technical feedback, and
      submitting PRs to maintain code quality and consistency across the codebase.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Frontend &amp; User Experience Contributions</h2>
